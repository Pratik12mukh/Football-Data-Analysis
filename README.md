## Introduction

In this project, we analyze football game data to gain insights into player performance, club statistics, and other relevant metrics. By exploring the dataset, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that can provide valuable information to football enthusiasts, clubs, and analysts.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/football-data-analysis.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary data files in the correct format.
2. Update the file paths in the code to point to the correct data files.
3. Run the code using a Python IDE or the command line: `python analyze_data.py`
4. Explore the generated visualizations and analyze the results.

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from various football datasets, including the English Premier League (EPL) 2020-2021 season. The dataset includes information about players, clubs, matches, goals, assists, yellow cards, and other relevant attributes.

The `EPL_20_21.csv` file contains the EPL data for the 2020-2021 season.

## Analysis

The code in this project performs the following analysis:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values.
2. Calculating derived columns such as minutes per match and goals per match.
3. Exploratory data analysis using visualizations to understand the data.
4. Statistical calculations and aggregations to derive insights.

## Results

The analysis of the football game data has revealed several interesting findings, including:

- Distribution of players' age groups.
- Clubs with the most and least number of players.
- Nations with the highest representation in the league.
- Players with the most goals assists, and yellow cards.
- Average age of players in each club.
- Relationship between goals and assists.
- And much more.
